# Clunky Gunky Games
**A small team of artists, storyline creators, and programmers.**

## About
We are a team of people who make games. The team consists of:
- KarmaBolt
- Argella
- BrokenTable
- Some Dumbass
- REMCodes

## Projects
We have not published any projects yet. We are currently working on a 2D story-based platformer game.

Stay tuned for more updates!

## Contributing
Haha, nope. Not yet, at least.

Well, you can DM REMCodes on Discord (REMCodes#1947) to request a testing key, or we will reach out to you with a key if we decide we want you
to test the game.

## Other
We're kind of slow at stuff, so our latest game won't be out for a while.
